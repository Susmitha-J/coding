Here are some of the coding questions I worked on, in the pursuit of learning different data structures and algorithms. 
This repository will contain codes written in different languages based on the problem statement.
Lets Begin 90 days Coding Pursuit.
=================================================================================================================

Day 1: 

Problem 1: Rotate array clockwise by one position
Problem 2: Count Pairs with given sum in a array
Problem 3: Check if an array is a subset of other array

==================================================================================================================

Day 2 
Problem 1: Rearrange elements in array by sign alternatively in order.
Problem 2: Rearrange elements in array by sign, equal number of even and odd.
Problem 3: Stack using Array
Problem 4: Queue using Array

==================================================================================================================

Day 3:
Problem 1: Re arrange elements and Maximum the sum in the array 
Problem 2: Remove duplicate characters in a array
Problem 3: Merge two strings alternatively starting with string 1
Problem 4: Reverse vowels in String

==================================================================================================================

Day 4:
Problem 1: Kids With Maximum Candies
