Here are some of the coding questions I worked on, in the pursuit of learning different data structures and algorithms. 
This repository will contain codes written in different languages based on the problem statement.
Lets Begin 90 days Coding Pursuit.

Day 1: 

Problem 1: Rotate array clockwise by one position
Problem 2: Count Pairs with given sum in a array
Problem 3: Check if an array is a subset of other array
